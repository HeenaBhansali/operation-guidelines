### Other Breaking Changes

#### Directive interface change

Directives no longer have instances - this means there's no more `this` inside directive hooks and `bind`, `update` and `unbind` now receives everything as arguments. (just store state on the element instead):

``` js
// example directive
export default {
  bind (el, value, modifiers, vnode) {
    // the context Vue instance can be accessed as vnode.context
  },
  update (el, value, modifiers, vnode) { ... },
  unbind (el, value, modifiers, vnode) { ... }
}
```

#### Filter Usage and Syntax Change

In Vue 2.0, there are several changes to the filter system:

1. Filters can now only be used inside text interpolations (`{{}}` tags). In the past we've found using filters with directives such as `v-model`, `v-on` etc. led to more complexity than convenience, and for list filtering on `v-for` it is more appropriate to move that logic into JavaScript as computed properties.

2. Vue 2.0 will not ship with any built-in filters. It is recommended to use standalone libraries dedicated for solving problems in a specific domain, e.g. [moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) for formatting dates and [accounting.js](http://openexchangerates.github.io/accounting.js/) for formatting financial currencies. You are also welcome to create your own filter pack and share it with the community!

3. The filter syntax has changed to be more inline with JavaScript function invocation, instead of taking space-delimited arguments:

  ```
  {{ date | formatDate('YY-MM-DD') }}
  ```

#### Transition System

Transition CSS class change: now uses the same classes Angular and React CSSTransitionGroup does:

  - `v-enter`: applied before element is inserted, remove after 1 tick. (starting state for enter)
  - `v-enter-active`: applied before element is inserted, removed when transition/animation finishes. (active + ending state for enter)
  - `v-leave`: applied right when the leave transition is triggered, remove after 1 tick (starting state for leave)
  - `v-leave-active`: applied right when the leave transition is triggered, removed when the transition/animation finishes. (active + ending state for leave)
  - `leaveCancelled` callback is no longer available for insertion/removals. Once a leave transition starts, it cannot be cancelled. It is, however, still available for `v-show` transitions.

`v-enter-active` and `v-leave-active` gives you the ability to specify different easing curves for enter/leave transitions. In most cases, upgrading means simply replacing your current `v-leave`with `v-leave-active`.

#### Misc

- `track-by` now expects a full expression instead of a string key. For example:

  ``` html
  <!-- 1.x -->
  <div v-for="item in items" track-by="id">

  <!-- 2.0 -->
  <div v-for="item in items" track-by="item.id">
  ```

- Interpolation inside attributes are deprecated:

  ``` html
  <!-- 1.x -->
  <div id="{{ id }}">

  <!-- 2.0 -->
  <div :id="id">
  ```

- Attribute binding behavior change: only `null`, `undefined` and `false` are considered falsy when binding attributes. This means `0` and empty strings will render as-is. For enumerated attributes. This means `:draggable="''"` will render as `draggable="true"`.

  Also, for enumerated attributes, in addition to the falsy values above, the string value of "false" will also render as attr="false".

- When used on a custom component, `v-on` now only listens to custom events $emitted by that component. (no longer listens to DOM events)

- `v-else` no longer works with `v-show` - just use negation expression.

- One time bindings (`{{* foo }}`) deprecated - use `v-once` instead.

- Array.prototype.$set/$remove deprecated (use Vue.set or Array.prototype.splice instead)

- `:style` no longer supports inline `!important`

- root instance can no longer use template props (use `propsData` instead)

- The `el` option can no longer be used in `Vue.extend`. It can now only be used as an instance creation option.

### Upgrade Tips

#### How to Deal with Deprecation of `$dispatch` and `$broadcast`?

The reason that we are deprecating `$dispatch` and `$broadcast` is that event flows that depend on the components tree structure can be hard to reason about when the components tree becomes large (simply put: it doesn't scale well in large apps and we don't want to set you up for pain later). `$dispatch` and `$broadcast` also do not solve the communication between sibling components. Instead, you can use a pattern similar to the [EventEmitter in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter): a centralized event hub that allows components to communicate, no matter where they are in the components tree. Because Vue instances implement the event emitter interface, you can actually use an empty Vue instance for that purpose:

``` js
var bus = new Vue()
```

``` js
// in component A's method
bus.$emit('id-selected', 1)
```
``` js
// in component B's created hook
bus.$on('id-selected', function (id) {
  // ...
})
```

This pattern can serve as a replacement for `$dispatch` and `$broadcast` in simple scenarios. But for more complex cases, it is recommended to introduce a dedicated state management layer using [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex).

#### How to Deal with the Deprecation of Array Filters?

For list filtering with `v-for` - one of the more common usage of filters - it is now recommended to use computed properties that return a processed copy of the original Array (see [updated data grid example](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/next/examples/grid/grid.js#L21-L41)). The benefits is that you are no longer limited by the arbitrary filter syntax/API - it's just plain JavaScript now, and you naturally have access to the filtered result because it is a computed property.
