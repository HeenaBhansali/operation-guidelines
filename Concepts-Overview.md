## Concepts Overview

VueJS shares a number of concepts with AngularJS. If you have used Angular before, you will find VueJS very easy to pick up.

Concept             | As in VueJS
:---                | :---
[View]              | The actual HTML that the user sees.
[Template]          | The HTML with additional markup.
[Model]             | A slightly modified plain JavaScript object.
[ViewModel]         | An object that syncs the Model and the View.
[Directive]         | A prefixed HTML attribute that tells VueJS to do something about an element.
[Filter]            | A function to process the value with before updating the View.
[Expression]        | Simple JavaScript expressions that can be used inside directives.
[Computed Property] | A model property that gets auto-updated when its dependencies change.
